/// \file block_host.hpp
/// \brief The block prefill's host stages: what runs on the CPU between the
///        GEMM dispatches of a 256-token block (OPEN-PREFILL-BATCH).
///
/// The 35B's DeltaNet recurrence, its attention over the KV rows and its
/// router are all on the host in the block route; the kernels do the
/// projections (whole-array GEMMs) and, one token at a time, the MoE block.
/// Every function here is the numpy reference open_kernels/model/replica_block.py
/// written out in C++ over T tokens with the state carried through the first
/// t_real of them: the kernels keep the conv state and the KV rows in bf16, so
/// those are rounded exactly as the device would; everything else accumulates
/// in double. block_host_test.cpp holds these to that reference's fixture.
