/// \brief The OpenAI wire vocabulary: finish_reason, error bodies, HTTP status.
///
/// These three are here rather than inside a handler for one reason: EVERY defect
/// #52 fixes is a case where one code path answered correctly and another, saying
/// the same thing, did not. The non-streaming responder mapped finish_reason and
/// the streaming one did not; one call site built a 400 body and the next three
/// had their own copies; the status mapper recognised 400 and let 500 through as
/// 200. A shared definition is what makes "the server always says this" a fact
/// rather than an intention, and these are pure functions so a test can hold them
/// to it without a server, a device or a model.
